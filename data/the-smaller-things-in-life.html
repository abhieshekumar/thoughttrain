                        I have made an observation and I feel it holds true generally in life.
                        <br/><br/>
                        You must have come across the idea of ‚Äî Thinking Big. I do agree with it. However, it will be easier and effective if we do not overlook the smaller ideas and minuscule details.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Let me give you an example. I am a computer engineering student and enjoy programming. Modular programming is an approach that emphasizes separating a program‚Äôs functionality into independent modules. These independent modules get better attention and work in orchestration to give an end-user application. The idea is to break down a larger idea, a user application into smaller and manageable modules to deliver the application. A very prominent work flow in software development is the Software Development Life Cycle which outlines a sequence of steps to be followed to deliver quality software.
                        <br/><br/>
                        All of us agree that the human body is the most complex machine. Most of its functioning comes from the cells, which are the basic building blocks of living things. There are different kinds of cells such as the brain cells, the blood cells, the muscle cells, the intestinal cells, the bone cells, and so on. All of these microscopic cells work in conjunction with each other which makes a human body function.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Here is another example, the whole world celebrates, say Valentine‚Äôs Day or Friendship Day‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwouldn‚Äôt it be more meaningful if people appreciated the smaller things in any relationship on a day to day basis and cherished those moments. These days will mean much more and will be a cherry on the top of a cake if we learn to initiate and appreciate the routine minuscule gestures.
                        <br/><br/>
                        You must have heard of The Butterfly Effect ‚Äî it states that a small change can make much bigger changes happen; one small incident can have a big impact on the future. The effect in some sense also focuses on the smaller details.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Also, sometimes I feel there is only enough information that the human mind can process efficiently. Having a goal broken down into smaller achievable tasks will make you see the progress instead of getting overwhelmed. It will become more manageable and practical to achieve. It also helps if you write down the steps as a list on a piece of paper to give it a concrete form, primarily because our thoughts can be abstract and assuming.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I will also suggest that while pursuing your goals please do not stop doing things you did in your leisure time. You may choose to do them less often, but do not abandon them. Listen to your favorite songs, be a part of those dinner gatherings, read a short story, or watch a short movie, if nothing amble or gaze at the night sky. I have experienced to have better focus and energy whenever I allowed some leisure time.
