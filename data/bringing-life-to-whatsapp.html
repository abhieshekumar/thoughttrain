                        </div>
                        Instant messaging has brought our daily conversations to a whole new level of experience. With the world hit by the pandemic such apps have garnered more audience as schools, colleges and businnesses have started using them regularly.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I get it, and very much appreciate the utility of such apps. But here is a problem and my remedy with such modes of conversation.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        Well I do not have a feature request or have a technical complaint. It is just that after a certain point I start missing the physical presence of the person whether it be a good colleague, a close friend, the setting of a place, say a classroom, or that favourite hanging spot.
                        Isn‚Äôt it exciting to listen to our close ones in their own voice, accompanied by their unique gestures and facial expressions instead of just reading their messages off a screen. Isn‚Äôt it meaningful to be able to sense the casualness, the mischievousness, the desperateness, the friendliness, or the coldness in their vocal tones. Isn‚Äôt it sensitizing to see them interact with others and with the objects in a setting. Isn‚Äôt it fair to miss the presence of people who fill up a room.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Sure emoticons exist, but a smile sent by different people is still the same smile. I do read messages off the screen but it feels impersonal.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h2>The Solution</h2>
                        One cannot deny that instant messaging has reduced the distance between people. Our dear and near ones are not more than a few taps away. However, as discussed, the converstations become disengaging and start sounding monotonous.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Here is what I do to make the conversations sound intersting to myself.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Consider mimicry artists, they observe people and are able to replicate them with exaggerated expressions, same goes for actors, instead they draw parallel from people to bring life to mostly fictional characters. You must have guessed where I am heading with it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If I have spend enough time around someone and happen to receive a message from them, I tend to add the voice along with the facial expressions and a few gestures while reading it. How hard is it to read a message received from your mother, as if she were saying it to you in person.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I use emoticons to imagine specific expressions of a person. It does make the conversation sound more interesting than simply reading it. There is also the added benefit of remembering such animated conversations for a longer duration of time.
