                        His teacher has lost count as to how many times she has corrected him for putting the wrong symbol between the two digits. And yet, it was there again, the same mistake.
                        <br/><br/>
                        "Well this has to be taught afresh."- she hushed while looking out of the window briefly without a blink. She had already reiterated that the pointed side of the symbol faced the smaller digit. But the mistake kept coming back. She also tried comparing the symbol with the mouth of an aligator which opened up to eat the bigger number. But the mistake kept coming back. "George, count out loud from one to hundred."
                        <br/><br/>
                        In his soft, chirpy voice he started counting up from one, taking brief pauses to look for a little shake of her head, or her deliberate blink, or a gentle sway of her hand as he progressed to the subsequent digits.
                        <br/><br/>
                        "There! would you please repeat it for me?", interrupted Eva. As George chirped out the digits she placed her finger over the question and looked at him with a slight spark in her eyes and almost a smile. Unable to decipher he stood waiting for one of her gestures.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Drawing her hands she rested them in her lap, took a deep breath and asked George calmly, "What comes after 12, dear?". She made up her mind not to spoon feed him the answer. "13", answered Geogre.
                        <br/><br/>
                        "So, which number is bigger?"
                        <br/><br/>
                        "13", cried George throwing his arms into the air.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Shifting her gaze she gestured towards the question in his workbook and repeated herself, "Which number is bigger?"
                        <br/><br/>
                        "Both, of them appear the same height"‚Ää-‚Ääreplied George innocently.
